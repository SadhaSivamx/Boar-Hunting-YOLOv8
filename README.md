## Boar-Hunting-YOLOv8
Developing a security system using YOLOv8 computer vision to detect intruding wild boars, triggering an Arduino-controlled buzzer for immediate alerting. This project enhances safety in rural areas by providing real-time threat detection and response.
## Dataset 
This security project utilizes YOLOv8 computer vision to detect intruding wild boars. It leverages a dataset sourced from Kaggle's Boar Detection dataset for training. for [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PaAYyNPF4YwqeW5jeR1KIUBy7wi_In1c/view?usp=drive_link)
